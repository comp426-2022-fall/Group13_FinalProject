Rock, paper, scissors

## Summary 
Oyr 'Rock, paper, scissors' game is a simple concept which allows more users to have fun and try to beat our bot in that mini-game. They need to have an account, and after that they are ready to go and enjoy their time. Moreover, for making it more competitvely there will be displayed a leaderboard where the best scores will be presented. Furthermore, for motivating the users, when they are losing against the computer their score will be affected in a negative way. Their final score is: their score - computer score.

## Demo
For taking a look at our demo please go on the following video. Even if is a simple concept, it can become adictive so do not hesitate to try it. We focused in creating a concept so far, considering that was challenging to find appropiate times to meet all of us and do proper development work. So, the video will be done by one person, but everyone contributed in that poject, having an amazing team work flow, and a great experience in the development process.

Moreover, we communicate daily and meet either in person or through zoom constantly for updating each other about how the project development is going on.

Before the first meeting we set up to do a session of brainstorming and come with several ideas that would be a good approach. Asfter that we had our first official in person meeting on 29th November where we assigned the tasks and made a plan. For questions or problems solutions we used an whatsapp group chat where we communicated. After that we had another meeting on 1st December were we updated all of us and set furthure targets. Next meeting was in person on 7th of December were we set everyhting up, made final changes and do a plan for the presentation.
